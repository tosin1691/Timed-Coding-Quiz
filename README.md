# Timed-Coding-Quiz
This is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. Quiz takers will have a set amount of time to complete a list of multiple choice questions that test their knowledge of front-end web development. The app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript that has been coded by me. 


## JavaScript

I used HTML, CSS and JS to create an app that:

1) Includes a start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears. Furthermore,
    * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
    * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
    * If the answer clicked is incorrect then 5 seconds is subtracted from the clock

2) The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
3) When the game ends, it displays their score and gives the user the ability to save their initials and their score
